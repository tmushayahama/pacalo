      "Pacalo was amazing!! They transported me on a stretcher (I have two broken legs) to my appointment an hour away. They waited for me and then drove me back. They were the kindest gentleman, always asking if I was comfortable and making sure I was okay. We had a wonderful time exchanging stories and talked the whole way back. I have never left a review before, but they were so nice to me and I felt safe that I just had to. Highly recommend using Pacalo Medical Transportation!!!",

They arrived on time, helped him in and out of the vehicle safely, and treated him with real respect and compassion. Highly recommend!",
